## ACEs proxy scores for ABCD data

Running this code will create an ACEs proxy score for Baseline, Yr1, Yr2, and Yr3.
Need to run the setup file (ELAfromABCD_setup.Rmd) first to create the necessary RDS and CSV files.
IMPORTANT: You will need to run the ENTIRE code to get correct scores for Years 1-3, as they build on each other.
